# ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead DayZMod, Installer Redux [1.8.9]
Welcome to the all new DayZMod installer. I decided to create a new installer because I was unhappy with the current installer. Setting up the server was far more tedious than it should be so I created this hoping that it will ease some frustrations while setting up new DayZMod servers.

# Folder Structure [1.8.9]
The server structure as well as the helper files are contained in "server.7z". The init script will download and install chocolatey and afterwards it will automatically download and extract the archive to your hard disk.

* _server
  * _cfgdayz
  * _scripts
    * mysqlbackup.bat
    * mysqlshutdown.bat
    * mysqlstartup.bat
    * watchdog.bat
  * _steamcmd
* arma-init.bat
* server.7z
