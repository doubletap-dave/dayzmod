# ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead DayZMod, Installer Redux [1.8.9]
Welcome to the all new DayZMod installer. I decided to create a new installer because I was unhappy with the current installer. Setting up the server was far more tedious than it should be so I created this hoping that it will ease some frustrations while setting up new DayZMod servers.

# Installation
Download 'setup.bat' and run it with admin privileges from anywhere on your system, it will navigate where it needs to go in order to set the system up.

# Folder Structure [1.8.9]
* files
* _server
  * _cfgdayz
  * _scripts
    * mysqlbackup.bat
    * mysqlshutdown.bat
    * mysqlstartup.bat
    * watchdog.bat
  * _steamcmd
* arma-init.bat
